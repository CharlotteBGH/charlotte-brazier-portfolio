# Charlotte Brazier portfolio
## Description
A portfolio website that showcases my skills and talents will be essential to my career search following completion of the bootcamp. To set myself up for the future, I have created a responsive website that illustrates the key areas I have studied, incuding flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. Elements include images that respond to screen size and an interactive nav bar.
